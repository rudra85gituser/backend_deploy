*servers are the software which serves data



*backend development
*2 major component 

a programing language---java,js,php,c++,golang
there are some libraries, functions and frameworks(react) available  through which we can do development

a database---mongodb,my sql,sqlite,postgres
tere are also some libraries and frameworks of database such as ORM and ODM , PRISMA ,MONGOOSE


*now user request for query  from data base , the request is made from front end side , there are many functions of a frontend , the request from any particular individual goes to server  ---> we create backend which convert the query requested by user in many formats json etc. , we write code for one backend and can be executed in many formats ---> compare or evaluate the functions in database , database is in another continent ---> reply is sent in the form of api , an api is form return value of a function which can be in many formats like json ,array,number


*express is used for routing
mongoose is used for database


*java script based backend 
1 data
2 file
3 third party (api)


*a js runtime : node js /demo/bun

*file structure - package.json      .env    (readmi,git,lint,prittier etc.)

1 index -  database connects to frontend
2 app - basic configuration,cookies
3 constants - 


database
models (schema for database , or pattern )
controllers (functionality of database)
routers 
middlewares
utils



*firstly we create some front end pages connect them
*secondly we create some functions in backend and also create a database (these functions help us to work with data entered by user and fetch data from data base)
these functions help us to deal with servers  (eg. when a person request for some webpage ,data in return he gets reply from the server)
*how to create a server(a server is nothing but a software which serves data )
* how to create a api
